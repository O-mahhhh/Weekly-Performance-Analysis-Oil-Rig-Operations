## Introduction

In large-scale industrial operations such as oil extraction, performance monitoring is essential for maximizing productivity, ensuring cost-efficiency, and maintaining quality standards. However, when data is spread across multiple teams and tools, it becomes difficult to gain a unified view of operational performance.

This project solves that challenge by designing a Weekly Performance Dashboard in Excel, analyzing production, cost, and quality metrics across four oil rigs. It integrates advanced Excel features such as DAX formulars (via Power Pivot), slicers, and data modeling to help stakeholders identify trends, compare rigs, and make informed decisions quickly.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard tracks the following weekly KPIs:

- Total Production Units – Total output per rig.
- Production Efficiency – Units produced per hour.
- Cost per Unit – Efficiency of each rig in managing cost per unit.
- **Average Work Hours – Average man-hours by employees.
- Quality Rate – Rate of defect-free units.
- Average Training Hours – Time spent training staff per week.
- Employee Count – Number of active personnel per rig.

These metrics help compare operational efficiency and workforce impact week-by-week.

## Skills Used

- 📊 Excel Dashboard Design
- 📂 Data Cleaning & Structuring
- 📈 Pivot Tables & Charts
- ⚙️ DAX (via Excel Power Pivot)
  - `SUM`, `DIVIDE`, `CALCULATE`, `AVERAGEX`, `FILTER`, `IF`, etc.

## Analysis and Visualization

Visualizations were created entirely in Excel, combining the

- Interactive slicers (Week 1–4)
- Dynamic cards for rig-level KPIs
- Conditional formatting for visual cues
- DAX formulas in Excel's Data Model for calculated fields
