## Introduction

In large-scale industrial operations such as oil extraction, performance monitoring is essential for maximizing productivity, ensuring cost-efficiency, and maintaining quality standards. However, when data is spread across multiple teams and tools, it becomes difficult to gain a unified view of operational performance.

This project solves that challenge by designing a Weekly Performance Dashboard in Excel, analyzing production, cost, and quality metrics across four oil rigs. It integrates advanced Excel features such as DAX formulars (via Power Pivot), slicers, and data modeling to help stakeholders identify trends, compare rigs, and make informed decisions quickly.

## Key Metrics

The dashboard tracks the following weekly KPIs:

- Total Production Units ‚Äì Total output per rig.
- Production Efficiency ‚Äì Units produced per hour.
- Cost per Unit ‚Äì Efficiency of each rig in managing cost per unit.
- **Average Work Hours ‚Äì Average man-hours by employees.
- Quality Rate ‚Äì Rate of defect-free units.
- Average Training Hours ‚Äì Time spent training staff per week.
- Employee Count ‚Äì Number of active personnel per rig.

These metrics help compare operational efficiency and workforce impact week-by-week.

## Summary and Conclusions

The Weekly Oil Rig Dashboard provides valuable insights into the operational performance of four oil rigs over a four-week period. By analyzing key indicators such as production volume, efficiency, cost, workforce training, and quality rates, this dashboard makes it easy to compare performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

**Rig 1** is the most productive in terms of total units but also incurs the highest production cost. **Rig 2** shows the best balance between cost-efficiency and consistent output. **Rig 3** leads in quality control, achieving the highest quality rate despite not being the top producer. **Rig 4** underperforms across most metrics‚Äîit has the lowest output, highest cost per unit, and lowest training hours, which correlates with its low quality rate.


## Recommendations

- **Improve Training on Rig 4**

The low training hours on Rig 4 may be contributing to its high defect rate and low efficiency. Invest in consistent training programs to improve staff skill and product quality.

- **Control Cost on Rig 1**

While Rig 1 delivers the highest output, its cost per unit is rising. Focus on optimizing inputs and reducing production wastage to lower total cost.

- **Replicate Rig 2‚Äôs Model**

Rig 2 offers a model for consistent and cost-effective production. Its balanced metrics suggest efficient management of resources. Apply similar operational strategies across other rigs.

- **Sustain Quality Leadership from Rig 3**

Rig 3‚Äôs strong performance in quality should be maintained and documented as best practice. Share quality control techniques with lower-performing teams.

- **Monitor Unit Cost Weekly**

Regular tracking of unit cost and quality rate helps prevent minor inefficiencies from becoming major operational issues. Continue using this dashboard for week-by-week comparisons and performance reviews.
